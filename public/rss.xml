            <title><![CDATA[Introducing Fluid compute]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[While dedicated servers provide efficiency and always-on availability, they often lead to over-provisioning, scaling challenges, and operational overhead. Serverless computing improves this with auto-scaling and pay-as-you-go pricing, but can suffer from cold starts and inefficient use of idle time. It’s time for a new, balanced approach. Fluid compute evolves beyond serverless, trading single-invocation functions for high-performance mini-servers. This model has helped thousands of early adopters maximize resource efficiency, minimize cold starts, and reduce compute costs by up to 85%.]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[The rise of the AI crawler]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[AI crawlers have become a significant presence on the web. OpenAI's GPTBot generated 569 million requests across Vercel's network in the past month, while Anthropic's Claude followed with 370 million. For perspective, this combined volume represents about 20% of Googlebot's 4.5 billion requests during the same period. After analyzing how Googlebot handles JavaScript rendering with MERJ, we turned our attention to these AI assistants. Our new data reveals how Open AI’s ChatGPT, Anthropic’s Claude, and other AI tools crawl and process web content. We uncovered clear patterns in how these crawlers handle JavaScript, prioritize content types, and navigate the web, which directly impact how AI tools understand and interact with modern web applications.]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Life of a Vercel request: What happens when a user presses enter]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[When developers push code, Vercel’s framework-defined infrastructure analyzes the codebase and intelligently provisions cloud resources. When requests come in, Vercel’s infrastructure instantly routes them to the nearest data center over a high-speed, low-latency network, delivering a response right back to the user. Vercel handles all of this behind the scenes. But understanding how your framework code powers the infrastructure—from deployment to request handling—gives you insight into how Vercel’s components work together, and enables you to further optimize user experiences. ﻿Here’s how Vercel manages requests at every stage.]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Life of a Request: Application-aware routing]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[Routing is a fundamental part of delivering applications, but it’s often treated as an afterthought—tacked onto the caching layer and configured through complex YAML or manual click-ops. This can introduce friction for teams, increase the risk of misconfigurations, and slow down deployments, especially as applications grow in complexity. Vercel takes a different approach: routing is built into the platform as an application-aware gateway that understands your codebase. This unlocks a range of capabilities that simplify development by reducing configuration overhead, minimizing latency, and enabling more advanced architectures. The gateway has full context of your deployments, domains, and logic. It supports standard routing and custom rules, but goes beyond reverse proxying by interpreting application logic in real time to make smarter decisions, like skipping unnecessary compute. Here’s how Vercel routes requests—and why it makes building performant, complex apps easier.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Grep is extremely fast code search. You can search over a million repositories for specific code snippets, files, or paths. Search results need to appear instantly without loading spinners. Originally built with Create React App (CRA) as a fully client-rendered Single-Page App (SPA), Grep was fast—but with CRA now deprecated, we wanted to update the codebase to make it even faster and easier to maintain going forward. Here's how we migrated Grep to Next.js—keeping the interactivity of a SPA, but with the performance improvements from React Server Components.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Securing web applications is core to the Vercel platform. It’s built into every request, every deployment, every layer of our infrastructure. Our always-on Denial-of-Service (DoS) mitigations have long run by default—silently blocking attacks before they ever reach your applications. Last year, we made those always-on mitigations visible with the release of the Vercel Firewall, which allows you to inspect traffic, apply custom rules, and understand how the platform defends your deployments. Now, we’re introducing Protectd, our next-generation real-time security engine. Running across all deployments, Protectd reduces mitigation times for novel DoS attacks by over tenfold, delivering faster, more adaptive protection against emerging threats. Let's take a closer look at how Protectd extends the Vercel Firewall by continuously mapping complex relationships between traffic attributes, analyzing, and learning from patterns to predict and block attacks.]]></description>
